      Iâ€™ve worked with Jon on a number of occasions, most recently in the world
      of regional TV commercials and corporate film making. Jon is as supportive
      as he is knowledgeable, in any aspect of Production - be it on-set as a
      Camera Assistant or as an Editor during the Post Production process. He
      retains an easy going nature with clients and co-workers when under
      pressure and clearly shows a passion for the industry whilst tackling any
      task with both skill and enthusiasm, despite the common industry
      constraints of time and budget. As a fellow professional, I would not
      hesitate in recommending Jon as someone who is totally able to both
      fulfill and deliver.

      Jon is a rare breed of designer that can successfully fuse creativity with
      technical know-how. His vast skill-set and knowledge mean that he knows
      exactly what is required to complete a project smoothly. He has never
      failed to meet any deadline or timescale I have ever set and they can
      often be quite unrealistic. His friendly and patient approach to work even
      when under pressure makes him a pleasure to work with.
